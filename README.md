# Food Recognition using Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains comprehensive details about my final-year thesis project which I have to complete as part of my undergraduate program.  

The repository contains -
1. Papers I have read in the area of food recogniton.
2. Research on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) that I read and loved.
3. Code in Python.
4. Project Reports.

I will keep on updating the repository as and when I have new updates.

Cheers.
