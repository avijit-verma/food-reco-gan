# Food Recognition using Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains comprehensive details about my final-year thesis project which I have to complete as part of my undergraduate program.  

The repository contains -
1. Papers I have read in the area of food recogniton.
2. Research on Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) that I read and loved.
3. Code in Python.
4. Project Reports.
5. Papers in the general area of deep learning.

I will keep on updating the repository as and when I have new updates.

UPDATE - I chose a semi-supervised learning approach to GAN's for the classification task and applied it to an Indian Food Dataset. I was able to achieve highest accuracy of ~83% on the test data after around 200,000 epochs of training. Currently, in the process of publishing these results in IEEE Signal Processing Letters.

Cheers.
